## About This Repository

This repository documents the technical work produced during Phase 1 of the TKH
Innovation Fellowship Cybersecurity program. It was built and maintained in the
role of Teaching Assistant — a position that in practice functioned as embedded
IT support, systems administration, and technical infrastructure for a cohort of
approximately 70 students across three sessions per week.

The work here spans environment provisioning, automation scripting, live
troubleshooting, user support, and technical documentation. Every script is
annotated with the security principle it demonstrates. Every analysis document
explains not just what was built, but the reasoning behind the implementation
decisions — the same reasoning a technician applies when diagnosing an unfamiliar
system or writing a runbook for a team.

**Program:** TKH Innovation Fellowship · [The Knowledge House](https://theknowledgehouse.org)
**Phase:** 1 — Cybersecurity Foundations
**Cohort Size:** ~70 students
**Schedule:** Monday / Tuesday / Wednesday · 5:30–8:30 PM EST
**Start Date:** March 9, 2026

## What This Role Actually Involved

This was not a grading role. The day-to-day technical work included:

- **Environment provisioning** — scripting and validating lab environments across
  70 student VMs running Ubuntu Server (headless) on VirtualBox and UTM
- **Live troubleshooting** — diagnosing SSH connection failures, Git authentication
  errors, broken file permissions, misconfigured paths, and failed bootstrap scripts
  in real time during sessions
- **User support at scale** — first-line technical support for 70 users with varying
  skill levels across macOS, Windows, and Linux environments
- **Documentation** — writing and maintaining technical guides, session notes, and
  reference scripts that students and future TAs could follow independently
- **Systems validation** — running pre-session environment checks to catch
  provisioning failures before they became classroom blockers
- **Script development** — building independent implementations of lab environments
  in bash and Python3, with inline annotations mapping each operation to its
  underlying security concept

## Week 01 — Three Sessions

### Night 1 · Terminal Genesis
VM orientation, headless Linux, FHS navigation, CLI fundamentals, and Git/GitHub
setup across 70 student environments. The TA bootstrap script (`setup_lab_01_jane.sh`)
was built independently before accessing instructor materials — it mirrors FHS
production directory conventions and includes a five-point environment verification
suite to catch provisioning failures before they surface as student blockers.

→ `week-01/scripts/` · `week-01/docs/comparison_night1.md`

```bash
# TA Reference Bootstrap
curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/janepierresgithub/5c7caec85fc26d272f43df34c8dbe4f3/raw/setup_lab_01.sh | bash
```

---

### Night 2 · The Keymaster
File permissions, `chmod`, `chown`, SUID auditing, and baseline system hardening.
The `harden.sh` script annotates each operation with its CIA Triad property and
NIST NICE framework mapping — making the script self-documenting for anyone who
needs to run or modify it without external reference.

→ `week-02/scripts/harden.sh` · `week-02/docs/NOTES.md`

---

### Night 3 · Stream Editing & Automation
`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, pipeline construction, and log interrogation. Students built
a forensic pipeline to extract attacker IPs from a simulated Apache access log under
SQL injection attack. The TA log generator produces 10,000 entries in full Apache
Combined Log Format with five randomized attacker IPs shuffled throughout — closer
to production forensic conditions than the class script's simplified format.

→ `week-01/scripts/setup_lab_03_jane.sh` · `week-01/artifacts/log_interrogation_pipeline.sh` · `week-01/docs/analysis_night3.md`

```bash
# The forensic pipeline — built live with 70 students
grep "UNION SELECT" ~/access.log \
    | awk '{print $1}' \
    | sort | uniq \
    > ~/threat_ips.txt
```

## Core Concepts — Week 01

### CIA Triad
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the conceptual backbone of every
decision in this program — from file permissions to firewall rules to forensic
pipeline design. Every script in this repository maps its operations to one or more
of these properties explicitly (Chapple et al., 2021).

### AAA Framework
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting map directly to the Linux permission
model. Git functions as an Accounting layer — every commit produces a cryptographic
hash that creates a tamper-evident, timestamped, attributed record of change.

### The Holy Trinity — grep / sed / awk
Three tools that together make the terminal a forensic instrument:
- `grep` — filters rows by pattern (The Scalpel)
- `sed` — mutates and replaces text on the fly (The Laser)
- `awk` — extracts specific columns from structured data (The Formatter)

### Principle of Least Privilege
Every `chmod` operation in this repository reduces permissions to the minimum
required for correct function — formalized by Saltzer and Schroeder (1975) and
applied here at the file system level.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit secrets** — no API keys, tokens, SSH private keys, or passwords
- Always inspect before executing: `cat script.sh` before `bash script.sh`
- Conventional Commits in use:
  - `feat:` — new lab material or script
  - `fix:` — corrections to existing content
  - `docs:` — documentation updates
  - `sec:` — security-related changes
